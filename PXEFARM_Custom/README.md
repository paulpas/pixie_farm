This is the first push of the customizations that I created.  These will so, but not limited to:

* Provide a means to dynamically configure your xmr-stak to optimized values
* Allow diskless clients to run the client with these values
* TODO: Add the script to build and install this stuff
* TODO: Turn it into an RPM, why not?
* TODO: Provide an installation script to start with a fresh server and configure EvErYtHiNg
* TODO: Make my scripts less hacky.  I use good form at work and toss code down in my free time, which is not much.
